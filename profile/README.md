## 📛 Naming Standards
### In Progress


## 🏷️ Tagging

[Leanix](https://footlocker.leanix.net/footlockerproduction/dashboard/aca7bb56-4b03-4813-8688-ae7d01db71a5)

Tag synchronization is handled automatically by a script that runs as part of our deployment or data processing pipeline. This script is responsible for identifying relevant resources, applying or updating tags based on predefined rules or metadata sources, and ensuring consistency across environments.

## 📥 How to Pull Code

Pulling code means fetching the latest changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local branch.

### Steps:
1. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
</details>

 
<details>
<summary>Branch Structure</summary> 

  ### Main Branches

  #### `main`
  - **Purpose**: Production-ready code that is stable and deployable
  - **Protection**: Protected branch with strict merge requirements
  - **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to production environment
  - **Merge Policy**: Only accepts merges from `hotfix/*` and `develop` branches
  - **Naming Convention**: `main`

#### `develop`
- **Purpose**: Integration branch where all features come together
- **Status**: Contains the latest development changes for the next release
- **Testing**: Continuous integration runs on every commit
- **Merge Policy**: Accepts merges from `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` branches
- **Naming Convention**: `develop`

### Supporting Branches

#### Feature Branches (`feature/*`)
- **Purpose**: Development of new features and enhancements
- **Lifetime**: Created from `develop`, merged back to `develop`
- **Naming Convention**: `feature/JIRA-123-description` or `feature/short-description`
- **Examples**:
  - `feature/USER-456-user-authentication`
  - `feature/API-789-payment-integration`
  - `feature/dashboard-redesign`

  <summary>Branch Protection Rules</summary>
 
### `main` Branch
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (minimum 2 approvers)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create merge commits
- ✅ Require administrator approval for emergency changes
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions

### `develop` Branch
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (minimum 1 approver)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions


## Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors
- ✅ Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized
- ✅ Add tests for new functionality
- ✅ Update documentation when necessary
- ✅ Self-review your code before requesting review
- ✅ Respond to feedback promptly and professionally


## Continuous Integration

### Required Checks
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Integration tests pass

### Environment Deployment

| Branch | Environment | Trigger | Access |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `main` | Production | Automatic on merge | Public |
| `develop` | Staging | Automatic on merge | Internal team |
| `feature/*` | Development | Manual or on push | Developers |

</details>


<details>
  <summary>Emergency Procedures</summary>
 
### Critical Production Issue
1. **Immediate Response**: Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. **Fast Track**: Bypass normal review process if necessary
3. **Communication**: Notify team leads and stakeholders
4. **Documentation**: Document the issue and resolution
5. **Post-Mortem**: Schedule retrospective to prevent recurrence

### Rollback Procedure
1. **Identify**: Determine the last known good commit
2. **Revert**: Create revert commit or hotfix
3. **Deploy**: Follow hotfix deployment process
4. **Monitor**: Verify system stability
5. **Investigate**: Analyze root cause offline
