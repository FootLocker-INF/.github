## üìõ Naming Standards
### In Progress


## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging
Tag synchronization is handled automatically by a script that runs as part of our deployment or data processing pipeline. This script is responsible for identifying relevant resources, applying or updating tags based on predefined rules or metadata sources, and ensuring consistency across environments.

<summary>Teams</summary>
 When creating teams, it's helpful to use acronyms in the team names to make it easier to identify and filter them.
<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

**Customer Experience ‚Üí Footlocker-CE**
**Infrastructure ‚Üí Footlocker-Infrastructure**
**Core Retail ‚Üí Footlocker-CR**
**Data Analytics ‚Üí Footlocker-DA**
This naming convention improves clarity and consistency across platforms.

 ### More Information
 
<details>
<summary>Branch Structure</summary> 

### Main Branches

#### `main`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code that is stable and deployable
- **Protection**: Protected branch with strict merge requirements
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to production environment
- **Merge Policy**: Only accepts merges from `hotfix/*` and `develop` branches
- **Naming Convention**: `main`

#### `develop`
- **Purpose**: Integration branch where all features come together
- **Status**: Contains the latest development changes for the next release
- **Testing**: Continuous integration runs on every commit
- **Merge Policy**: Accepts merges from `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` branches
- **Naming Convention**: `develop`

### Supporting Branches

#### Feature Branches (`feature/*`)
- **Purpose**: Development of new features and enhancements
- **Lifetime**: Created from `develop`, merged back to `develop`
- **Naming Convention**: `feature/JIRA-123-description` or `feature/short-description`
- **Examples**:
  - `feature/USER-456-user-authentication`
  - `feature/API-789-payment-integration`
  - `feature/dashboard-redesign`
